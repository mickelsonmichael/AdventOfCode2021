# Day 13 - Transparent Oragami

This one was difficult initially (man I hate multi-dimentional arrays at this point), but once I got a proper print statement set up it was a breeze. I really went overboard with the print statement though, it maybe took more time to set up than it was ultimately worth. But dang doesn't it look snazzy?

Things I improved on today:

- Some more practice with Python's array/tuple deconstruction
- Fun with unicode â–ˆ
