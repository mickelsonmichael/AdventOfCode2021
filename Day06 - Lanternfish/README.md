# Day 6 - Lanternfish

I really quite enjoyed this day. I appreciate days like this one, where you do something an initial way in part 1 (I utilized a Lanternfish class), then part 2 enters and you realize your first solution was totally inefficient at scale! It was a lot of fun to take a solution I already had and improve its efficiency. The efficient solution was pretty striaghtforward, so there's not much to say beyond how much I enjoyed it.

Things I improved on today:

- Thinking about solutions outside of OOP solutions, not over-abstracting things
