# Day 11 - Dumbo Octopus

Today was a pretty fun one, again not much to say (I'm writing most of these "journals" weeks after the fact and so I can only remember so much). Got some more practice with [list comprehensions](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions) and I think I'm getting the hang of them. I also got some additional practice with tuples, which I had explored in earlier days but never kept in as they were usually replaced with a class or array.

Things I improved on today:

- More [list comprehensions](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions)
- Tuples in Python
