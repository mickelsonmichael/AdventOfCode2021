# Day 12 - Passage Pathing

It's quite fortunate that I completed a course on this very topic (traversing graphs) mere days before tackling this one. That made it a breeze and I was able to utilize some of my fresh knowledge to handle the problem easily. I did have a momentary setback when I didn't realize that connections went both ways, but once I got that deduced it was a nice jog to the finish line.

Things I improved on today:

- Graph traversal
