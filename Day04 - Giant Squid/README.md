# Day 4 - Giant Squid

This was the first day it really struck me that I was over-architecting things. At this point I didn't think I needed to change anything however, because it didn't take a long time, but I did acknowledge the fact that I really enjoy architecting things but I'm very slow at it (I like everything to be "perfect", or as perfect as I can perceive).

Things I improved on today:

- Learned how to perform ternary operations in Python (e.g. `"good morning" if morning == True else "good evening"`)
- Learned how to write `lambda` statements in Python
- How to use multiple files for classes in Python
- Learned Python's `map` and `filter` functions
