# AdventOfCode2021

This is my process through the Advent of Code 2021. I used this as an opportunity to learn Python (days 2 - 14) and refine my C++ skills (day 15+).

My answers are generally a mix between over-architected or me attempting to script quickly.

## Update: December, 29 2021

Now that the Advent of Code has been officially wrapped up, I'll make this repository public so I can share my answers easily with others. I am also going back an recording a brief journal for each of the completed days. Because I'm doing this after the fact, the easier days with few events will have fewer details, since I can only remember so much from weeks ago. But hopefully for future days (16+) I will have more detailed descriptions of my efforts.
