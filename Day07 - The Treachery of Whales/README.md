# Day 7 - The Treachary of Whales

This one was unecessarily "easy", I wasted a lot of time looking through the `numpy` library for methods that would give me what I wanted besides the actual solutions (`median` and `mean`). I just couldn't believe that the soultion was so easy, so I continued to try new methods until finally accepting that it really was that obvious. This was probably my fastest day in terms of actual programming.

It is worth noting that at one point I perform a `floor` to get the appropriate answer, however this only works some of the time. After a discussion with my co-worker Graham and reading some reddit threads, it turned out that the answer could be either the `floor` or the `ceil` of the `mean`. The only way to determine which one it is easily is to try both answers and see which sticks.

Things I improved on today:

- Utilizing the `numpy` library
