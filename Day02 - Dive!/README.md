# Day 2 - Dive!

I initially completed Day 2, but having extra time on my hands created `Day2_alt.py` which is a slightly modified version in which I print out a tiny submarine. I think this adds a nice bit of flair to the equation and it was good to learn how to implement classes in Python. I had to learn pretty quickly that in python, instance methods require the first parameter to be `self`, a reference to the instance the method is being called on.

Things I improved on today:

- Learned how to read files in Python
- Learned how to created classes in Python
- Learned how to create instance methods in Python
