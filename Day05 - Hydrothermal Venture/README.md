# Day 5 - Hydrothermal Venture

I'm alraedy getting tired of working with multi-dimentional arrays during the AOC. I realize they're important, especially for interviews, but they are quite tedious and I don't enjoy doing them repeatedly if I don't have to.

I did find out about [list comprehensions](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions) in Python and boy did it take me a little bit to wrap my head around it. It's such an alien way of formatting things, and yet it's incredibly powerful. I'll definitely need more practice with it.

Today I improved on:

- Learning the `sum` function in Python
- Learned the `itertools.tee` function in Python for repeating objects
- Learned [list comprehension](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions) in Python.
