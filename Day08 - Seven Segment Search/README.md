# Day 8 - Seven Segment Search

This one was a lot of fun, I really enjoyed writing the solution for it. I didn't even realize that the answer to part 1 was just a count of the unique numbers, and so I solved part 2 first by mistake and had to backtrack to get the part 1 solution.

It's becoming obvious that there are several kinds of questions, and this is one of those questions where there's a ton of explanation. I don't particularly like those ones, because it slows me down to have to read and grok and entire essay before actually beginning to code. It also felt like part 1 was a cop out, because they really wanted the soultion to part 2 but couldn't think of a better question for part 1.

Things I improved on today:

- Utilizing assertions in Python
