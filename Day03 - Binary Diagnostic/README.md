# Day 3 - Binary Diagnostic

Today I begin my journey into over-architecting things and needlessly making the output too pretty. I wasted a lot of time on the `print` statements on this one (and all future ones, honestly).

Python is pretty good for working with binary strings, there are a lot of good helper methods built-in to make it a breeze.

Things I improved on today:

- Working with binary strings (in Python and in general)
- Deep vs shallow copying in Python
- Creating constructors in Python
