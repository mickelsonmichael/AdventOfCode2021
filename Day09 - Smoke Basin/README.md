# Day 9 - Smoke Basin

I wasted a _lot_ of time on this one because I didn't read it properly. I was comparing everything equal to nine, when really I needed to compare greater than nine. I couldn't figure out why my solution wasn't working until I went to the effort to print out an entire parsed view of the map and it because abundantly clear. Beyond that it wasn't a terribly difficult soultion.

Things I improved on today:

- Utilizing typehints in Python
